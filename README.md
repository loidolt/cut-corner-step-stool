# Cut Corner Step Stool

With kids learning to use the sink in a tight bathroom, I had to cut some corners.

## General Info

A simple step stool for kids to use the sink with the corner cut out so the door can open and close past it.

I cut this all in 2.5D on the CNC and then added the 67.5-degree angles for the skirt bend on the table saw. Assembly was done with glue and clamps except a couple of nails to hold the skirt angle while drying since it was difficult to clamp.
